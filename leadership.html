               Leadership is about teaching the Youth how to grow up with this type of community,
without anything bad happening in their environment.
Some Youth communities grow up in a different life styles than others do thats why,
their is a  point for leadership.This is why most successfull people build a 
organization for kids that don't grow up in good places and aren't getting
taught correctly.
